## Kohonen Map


### Description

A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organising feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples for the dimensionality reduction. 

This project is a combination of Kohonen Map and Feed Forward Neural Network (own implementation of both algorithms) to predict the classic MNIST numerical problem.
