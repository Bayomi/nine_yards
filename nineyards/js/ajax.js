1. The main usage of interactivity with Javascript will be done with JQuery functions. 
The main idea is to display a hover parameter on each image and make each of them clickable. 
Anytime someone hovers over an image, it should show a caption, a button to get more information 
and image should also be clickable. When the user is redirected to another page, there will 
be a JQuery button to also display information about the ladies that developed the project. 
9Y idea is to not look charitable and focus on the product, but they also want to show the
beautiful stories behind each product. Thatâ€™s a way to show some more specific information 
with ajax calls when someone clicks the determined button.

2. Moreover, it will be necessary to make the editing process very simple. The best way
to do that is using an interaction with PHP and JS.  By this way, we can make the changing
process easy to deal with and also make some changes last forever and not only for the 
specific user with Cookies. Using some HTML5 properties, it will be easy to edit texts,
change photos and provide new information.

3. Also, using the library D3.js, we intend to build an interactive map that could be accessed 
by any part of the website. By the display of the map, all the colored countries would be 
available to click on and the function would redirect them to a page with all the products 
from that determined country or region and also a brief explanation about the country and 
the stories related. Also, every time someone buys an item from a different region of the world, 
each product page will be able to display a map with all the countries that already have bought
similar products or from that same country. We believe that this design solution could create 
an empathy impact between different regions around the world.
